Just like with JavaScript coding standards, we use the same rules for writing CSS as defined in the [frontend handbook](https://handbook.infinum.co/books/frontend/SASS%20Styleguide/File%20organization).

We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in our projects and the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology to write HTML.
