The Infinum's WordPress boilerplate is the basis of every WordPress based project we use at Infinum.

The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/infinum/wp-boilerplate).

## General info

The Infinum's WordPress boilerplate is an easy way to kickstart your WordPress development using modern programming practices. We wanted to exploit all the advantages of the best PHP practices, which is why we used namespacing to ensure avoiding any possible class, method and function clashes in the global namespace. We also implemented the autoloader which means you no longer need to manually require your classes. Just instantiate them and the autoloader will take care of the rest. With the added performance boost.

We also used Webpack to bundle all the assets (images, JavaScript, fonts and Sass files). This will introduce you to the concepts of modern JavaScript development. Besides all the advantages that Webpack offers (Browsersync plugin that makes cross-device development super easy), it enables you to use all the interesting ES6 features (arrow functions, classes, exports etc.).

There are other added bonuses that you can explore by reading the readme of the project.

This is the in-depth documentation on how to run and modify the WordPress boilerplate code. The intended usage of this boilerplate is to introduce modern front-end development tools to WordPress.
