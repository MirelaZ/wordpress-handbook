When working on enterprise projects, it is vital to follow the best security practices. Security and risk assessment are a crutial part of software development. Security is also everyone's job and should be embedded in each business process and operation.

## Core concepts

The application security core concepts are primarily concerned with reducing the primary attack surface - our exposure, the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities that we could have in our software. It's crucial to make it as small as possible because the app controls the access to the data and the sources of the software.

The core security process is also known as the 'CIA triad'

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

_Confidentiality_ means protecting sensitive data from improper disclosure, which can have legal and contractual consequences to you or the company you work for. One of the things you can do to mitigate this and ensure the confidentiality of your application is to mask and obfuscate access to the application through the usage of passwords, make view based access controls for the database access and use encryption when dealing with data transfer and data storage.

_Integrity_ concerns with the protection of the sensitive data from unauthorized modification and ensure compliance and security of the data processing according to law. Some of the way you can ensure data integrity is by using digital signatures ([GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) or [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) using hashes). We need to be sure of the proof of sender - signed data by you so you cannot say you didn't do it/send it, and proof of non alteration in transit. This is what integrity is all about.

_Availability_ is the prevention of destruction of data or systems and the ability to maintain the operational capability. We need to assess where the software could fail (single point of failure), and We need to provide fault tolerance - a redundancies that will automatically take over the running of the application/service in case of failure. If the application crashes on one container, for instance, another should automatically boot up to replace it with a minimal timeout. We need to take care of the scalability.

## Risk management

A risk is a likelihood (probability) of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, thereby causing damage to an asset.

Risks will regulate the number of controls (limitations) that will be used to reduce the risk to the organization. Risk can be good or bad - investments are risky, but can pay off if you made a good investment.

Risk is not eliminated, it is managed. We need to assess the possible risks, respond to them, and monitor them. This all constitutes a risk context or frame.

Once we assess the risk we can choose to: _avoid the risk_ (don't implement certain feature that is deemed too risky and can introduce a vulnerability); _transfer the risk_ (third party insurance - you assigned somebody else to do a part of the app for instance); _accept the risk_ (know the limitations and implement the feature); _reduce/mitigate a risk_ (implement monitoring and logging on an application for instance).

## OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an on-line community which produces freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security

## Some tips

Never store passwords, or critical information on the git or any versioning system. Never store `wp-config.php` credentials in the code as well.

One of the secure ways would be to use environment variables that can be injected in the app during deployment. Then you can use them in you application with [`getenv()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php) function.

When working with environment variables in PHP, be sure to disable `phpinfo()` function, as the environment variables are usually visible in it.

Another way, if you are using AWS and EC2 or ECS instances, could be to store credentials in encrypted S3 bucket, and pull them using the methods available in [aws-sdk-php](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/).

## Security tools

### Code sniffer

The first tool to install in every project is [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/).

Boilerplate already comes bundled with [coding standards](https://github.com/infinum/coding-standards-wp), which depends on code sniffer. Using composer you can install it like this

```bash
composer require infinum/coding-standards-wp --dev
```

Code sniffer tokenizes your code against a set of sniffs, that watch for best practices and possible security issues.

### SonarQube

SonarQube is an open source quality managment platform. It will make a static code analysis and check your code for code smells, bugs and possible security vulnerabilities.

It can be run from docker. The installation instructions can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube/).

You need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) first. After that pull the sonarqube docker image

```bash
docker pull sonarqube
```

And start the sonarqube server

```bash
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube
```

The local SonarQube can be accessed in the browser on `localhost:9000`.

![sonarqube](/img/sonarqube.png)

[Analyzing with scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) tutorial.

You can log in as admin with `admin` user and `admin` password. You can add the project by going to `Administration->Projects`. You may be prompted to enter a token name and generate a token. Be sure to remember that token, as it will be used when creating a `sonar-project.properties` file needed to run the scan.

You'll also need to install Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and `sonar-scanner` using brew

```bash
brew update
brew cask install java

brew install sonar-scanner
```

In the project root you'll need to add a `sonar-project.properties` file in the root of the project (`public_html`) that looks something like this

```
sonar.projectKey=project-key
sonar.projectName=Project Name
sonar.projectVersion=1.0.0
sonar.login=4CqVnlU9PzqKUjBqaHu3oGiPhHAv1PrC4pRrhgOA

sonar.sources=wp-content/themes/,wp-content/plugins/
```

After that you should go to the project root and run `sonar-scanner`.

In the event of a failure, you can capture the output in a log file with

```bash
sonar-scanner -X &> ~/Desktop/sonar-log.txt
```

After a scan is done (should take a while) you'll see the report in the SonarQube UI

![sonarqube report](/img/sonarqube-report.png)

If you already have an existing docker image, you can start it by

```bash
docker start sonarqube
```

And you can stop it with

```bash
docker stop sonarqube
```
### WPScan

[WPScan](https://wpscan.org/) is a WordPress scanning tool that runs on docker.

To install WPScan on your mac, you need to have docker installed. After you installed docker pull the image with

```bash
docker pull wpscanteam/wpscan
```

Start the scan with

```bash
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan -u https://yourblog.com [options]
```

You would change `https://yourblog.com` with your local installation of WordPress. You can see the option list [here](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#wpscan-arguments). Or just leave that empty.

That will run the WPScan and provide output that looks something like this (output may vary)

```bash
