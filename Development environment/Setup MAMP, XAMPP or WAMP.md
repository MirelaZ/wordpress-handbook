Setuping MAMP, XAMPP or WAMP is easy as just downloading and installing them.

[MAMP install](https://www.mamp.info/en/)

[XAMPP install](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

[WAMP install](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

Just follow the instructions and install them.

## Notes

If you're running Windows - here at Infinum you probably won't, but it doesn't hurt to inform you of some possible issues.

XAMPP is known to occupy the same port as Skype, so be sure to run XAMPP before you turn Skype on.
